# Meme dream

## Overview

Ever wanted to catch with friends and find more relevant memes they have posted? Trying to find Rock and Morty gifs for your facebook or slack chat?

Meme dream is a infinite-scrolling visualization / tumblr-influenced site where users can search for tags, view other popular tags and (possibly) vote on images. Each user will have unique feeds.


## Data Model

The application will store Users, Votes and Tags

* users can have multiple lists (via references)
* each list can have multiple items (by embedding)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "andrew",
  password: //hash;
  votes: [] // array of voted on items;
  tags: [] // list of tags that the user has liked
}
```

An example image
```javascript
{
  name: "Mona Lisa",
  path: '/img/lisa.jpg' // store path;
  votes: 25, // array of voted on items;
  tags: ['art', 'renaissance', 'Da Vinci'] // list of tags that the user has liked
}
```
---
An Example Image with Embedded Item:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: "Breakfast foods",
  items: [
    { name: "pancakes", quantity: "9876", checked: false},
    { name: "ramen", quantity: "2", checked: true},
  ],
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```

## Wireframes

(___TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc._)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

![list create](documentation/list-create.png)

/list - page for showing all shopping lists

![list](documentation/list.png)

/list/slug - page for showing specific shopping list

![list](documentation/list-slug.png)

## Site map

(___TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other_)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

## User Stories or Use Cases

(___TODO__: write out how your application will be used through [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Format) and / or [use cases](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs&_ga=1.47552679.1838903181.1489282706#previous)_)

1. as non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can create a new grocery list
4. as a user, I can view all of the grocery lists I've created in a single list
5. as a user, I can add items to an existing grocery list
6. as a user, I can cross off items in an existing grocery list

## Research Topics

(___TODO__: the research topics that you're planning on working on along with their point values... and the total points of research topics listed_)

* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using passport for user authentication
    * And account has been made for testing; I'll email you the password
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/register</code> for register page
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/login</code> for login page
* (4 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * see <code>cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/ait-final/my-form</code>
    * if you put in a number that's greater than 5, an error message will appear in the dom
* (5 points) vue.js
    * used vue.js as the frontend framework; it's a challenging library to learn, so I've assigned it 5 points

10 points total out of 8 required points (___TODO__: addtional points will __not__ count for extra credit_)
